                <h3 class="title">ROBREDO, LENI</h3>
                <p class="text">Leni Robredo, 56, is currently serving as the 14th vice president of the Philippines. Her office has garnered the highest audit rating from the Commission on Audit for three consecutive years (2018-2020) and has been recognized by Malacañang for its pandemic response programs across the country.</p>
                <p class="text">In her lone term in the House of Representatives, Robredo principally authored three bills that were signed into law, including the Tax Incentives Management and Transparency Act.
                    If elected, Robredo says she will spend her first 100 days in office strengthening the country’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
